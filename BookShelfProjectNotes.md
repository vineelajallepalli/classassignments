# BookShelf Project

   We finished our project successfully .First, I had no idea what to do as I didn't understand everything about REACT.But, as it is a group project we discussed about it and Landon took care of the functional part.Meanwhile, I 
   have watched some react tutorials.I helped with a little bit of CSS part with Prentice and Ashley.I am not satisfied as I couldn't contribute much to the project but as this is my first Project I came to know how can we work as a team and accomplish.I will try to work on things and get better and do my best in my next project.
